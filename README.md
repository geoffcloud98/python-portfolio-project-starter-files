This project involves analyzing a single CSV file, focusing on fundamental data manipulation techniques without relying on external libraries like Pandas. It includes calculating the average age, identifying the most common region, and determining the probability of an individual with children being male or female. The project emphasizes manual data operations such as iterating through data, performing calculations, and generating insights from tabular data using core Python functions.

The goal is to strengthen foundational skills in handling and analyzing CSV data by implementing custom functions to calculate averages, frequencies, and probabilities. Through this approach, the project provides a solid introduction to data analysis workflows in Python, while avoiding more automated libraries to reinforce the logic behind data manipulation.
